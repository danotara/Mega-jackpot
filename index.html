	<h2 style="color: red:"><b>BBRIGTON VS WESTHAM UNITED</h2></b>
	<p>West Ham will be aiming to stay in the Champions League race when they take on Brighton in the Premier League round 36. David Moyes is doing a great job with the capital club, and we are positive that they will stick to their attacking style of play. A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Jesse Lingard, who joined the club in the January transfer window.

Both Rice and Masuaku are likely to miss the match with injuries, while Lanzini and Noble should be fit to face Brighton. The Seagulls, on the other hand, will be without key attacker Maupay in Saturdayâ€™s clash as he was sent off in the 2-1 loss to Wolverhampton. Since defender Dunk is banned for the match as well, we are tempted to put our money on the Hammers, who are determined to secure a top-four fin</p>
