	<h2 style="text-align:center;" ><b>BRIGTON VS WESTHAM UNITED</h2></b>
	<p style="text-align: center;"  >West Ham will be aiming to stay in the Champions League race<br> when they take on Brighton in the Premier League round 36.<br> David Moyes is doing a great job with the capital club<br> and we are positive that they will stick to their attacking style of play<br> A man to keep an eye on in the away team will be Jesse Lingard<br> who joined the club in the January transfer window.<br>

Both Rice and Masuaku are likely to miss the match with injuries<br> while Lanzini and Noble should be fit to face Brighton.<br> The Seagulls, on the other hand, will be without key attacker Maupay<br> in Saturdayâ€™s clash as he was sent off in the 2-1 loss to Wolverhampton.<br> Since defender Dunk is banned for the match as well, we are tempted to<br> put our money on the Hammers who are determined to secure a top-four fin</p>
